# Interests and Activities

At home, I maintain my self-built unRAID server. This hosts Plex and a number of media management services. I also have constructed 2 other PCs in my home, one for myself and one for my brothers, along with numerous PCs for friends. I try to keep informed with hardware developments in the PC enthusiast market. Recently I have become interested in furthering my programming skills using online courses and books.

I enjoy cooking and baking at home. I often like to research new recipes and methods for cooking foods I enjoy. I try to cook at least one meal for myself or others each day. Recently I have begun growing plants on my windowsill, starting with 3 apache pepper plants, 2 dill plants and 1 basil plant. In the future, I plan to use an Arduino or similar IoT device to monitor the soil moisture level in these plants and graph them on the unRAID server.

I enjoy playing competitive video games with others. I enjoy working as a team in these with my peers.
