# Summary
More progress this week, pumpkins have grown out even more, slugs seem to be present so I need to deal with them.
Had to trim the butternut squash again as it seemed to have mildew, which is my own fault for watering improperly. 
Some animal had gotten into the bed one night and destroyed the smallest butternut squash also.

Although I'm only going to end up keeping the largest of the pumpkin plants, the smallest seems to be developing downy mildew,
 so I'll have to monitor it over the next week.

Largest strawberry is starting to turn red! There's not many growing on either plant yet however.

I plan to redo the entire SFG plan later in the year, replacing the herbs with a proper plant, instead choosing
to grow the herbs in a seperate container later.
