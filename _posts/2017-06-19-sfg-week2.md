# Summary
Some progress this week, pumpkins have grown out more, largest buttnernut squash leaf had been damaged so was removed.
Smallest butternut squash is growing a third leaf, so I guess it's growing just fine again after transplanting.

Also moved some strawberries nearby on an old bird feeder, to get more sun than it was getting in the previous position.
