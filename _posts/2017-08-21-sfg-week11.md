# Summary
Further updates. The butternut squash has still yet to flower so I took no pictures of it, it likely won't in time for a good harvest.

The pumpkins have started to bear fruit, however since taking this picture, the largest has been damaged and removed from the plant.
The pumpkin plant has also been pruned back, with some vines cut far back and some fruit removed. There are currently two fruit growing, I may 
allow two more to grow, depending on where they grow from.

There was also some damage on the leaves, not by slugs this time but from earwigs, I was able to manually remove and exterminate some of them at night, but they will likely be back, so I will have to keep an eye on them.
