# Summary
First update in months due to being out of the country doing training for work.
The butternut squash and pumpkin have grown dramatically since, but have yet to start growing fruit. The vines 
from the butternut squash will need to be trained onto the trellis over the next couple of weeks. For now I've 
removed one of the pumpkin plants (which I meant to do a month ago) and trimmed back the plants to the better
stalks.
