After finishing my Networking Technologies degree in DIT, I decided that I wanted to start a home networking revamp to prove to myself that I could and to refresh my skills. I decided that I wanted to completely redo every aspect of the network, except for my ISP connection. I chose to break this down into 5 steps.

**Part 1: Install and configure Cisco 2901 Router**

From my work placement last year, I was able to acquire 3 Cisco 2901 routers. I decided to re-purpose one of them into my own home router after my previous router (A Mikrotik RB951G) failed.

**Part 2: Redesign "heart" of network**

The next step involves securing a proper rack solution, installing a 24port switch, and transferring my current media server into a new, rack-mountable case

**Part 3: Install new Access Points**

Currently I am using a leftover Mikrotik RB951G and an old DLINK DIR-655 to provide wireless access through my house. I plan to replace these with PoE Access Points. I am planning to use Ubiquiti Unifi AP AC Lites as my access points, because they are relatively cheap for the features offerred.

**Part 4: Run Cat6 through attic and add wall panels for ethernet**

The final step is to replace the Cat5e cables running through the attic with Cat6\. I also plan to terminate these properly in a wallÂ plate, instead of having a cable hanging down from the ceiling which is what is done currently.
